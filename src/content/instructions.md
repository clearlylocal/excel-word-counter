# Instructions

This tool is for checking the word count from multiple files.

1. Upload one or more Excel files or a zip file containing multiple Excel files.
2. Check debug data looks correct (_Rows counted per file_).
3. Export to an Excel file using the **Export** button or view _Word count per user_ results in the web app.

Note that word count is based on _source words_ (in the `eng` column). Invalid rows (e.g. rows with no `user_name` specified) are not counted.
