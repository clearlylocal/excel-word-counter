# Instructions

This tool is for checking the word count from multiple files.

1. Upload one or more files.
2. Check debug data looks correct (_Rows counted per file_).
3. Take results from _Word count per user_.

Note that word count is based on _source words_ (in the `eng` column). Invalid rows (e.g. rows with no `user_name` specified) are not counted.
