# Instructions

This tool is for checking the word count from multiple files.

1. Upload one or more files.
2. Check debug data looks correct (_Rows counted per file_).
3. Take results from _Count per linguist_.

Note that word count is based on _source words_ (in the **eng** column). Invalid rows (e.g. rows without data in the column matching the file name\*) are not counted.

\* For example, if the file is named `Need_Translate_To_vi_for-20220824060307` and there is no data in the **vi** column.
